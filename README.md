ansible role: akku warning
==========================

# rewrite in progress!!!
```
cronjob is going to be removed!
systemd timer intruduces
variables may change!

TODO: Verhalten bei akku losen ger√§ten verbessern!
```


This ansible role installs a bash script (per cronjob) which is executed every 3 minutes. This bash script checks if the battery level is below 25 percent and is currently not charging. If this is the case, the program [zenity](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenity) installed by this role will generate a popup message stating that the battery is low.
While the battery level is between 15 and 10 percent, it will also attempt to play a sound. But this does not (yet) work reliably.

This role is tested with the [i3 - improved tiling wm](https://i3wm.org/), installed by [this role](https://github.com/chaos-bodensee/role-i3wm.git) at Archlinux, but probably will work on all window magers and the most operating systems!

### install with galaxy:
```bash
ansible-galaxy install do1jlr.akku_warning

```

```
